Capstone Project 4
Task 20 - Javascript fundamentals

I used my website from my previous Capstone Project.

I implemented a save_for_later function which a user can click an icon to save menu items/categories to a save for later page.
In doing so, they are alerted that their item was saved. If they had already saved that item, they will be alerted that it was already saved.
The alert tells you exactly how many items are in the save for later folder too.

Users can now leave a review of their experience at the restaurant when visiting the about page.

A new like button has also been added. Users can heart their favorite meals/ menu categories.

If users choose to visit the restaurant and would like to make a reservation, they can now do so by visiting our reservation page.

The website is responsive and mobile-friendly.

Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following
jQuery functionality:
● A function which contains hiding/showing. (hovering over the menu items/categories)
● A drop-down menu. (click the menu icon on each page to view the dropdown)
● Animation effects.(animated the menu icon to bounce as you load each page)
● A function with chained effects (the menu icon has a chained effect which performs the chained effect when clicked. it drops down smoothly,
and if clicked again, closes smoothly too. )
